# WIKIPEDIA SCRAPER PROJECT

### By: Muhammad Firdauyi

The aim of the enacting of this project is to apply the concept of Regular Expression in establishing pattern over string-based data, and to manipulate those data in a much higher context of implementation, which is web-scraping

This project, under normal circumstances, should be be able to demonstrate the author's capacity in these following domains: 
1. Regular Expression (RegEx) pattern configuration and implementation,
2. File-Handling, 
3. API Query, the implementation of Asychronous Request notwithstanding,
4. Using external web-scraping library (in this instance: BeautifulSoup)
